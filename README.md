# Motif-Detection
This project performs **motif frequency analysis**, **base composition analysis**, and **clustered heatmap visualization** on DNA sequences stored in a FASTA file. It calculates the occurrences and density of selected DNA motifs, measures GC/AT content, and visualizes motif density using hierarchical clustering.
